## About

This is a sample Laravel application which integrates with the [Fusio Laravel SDK](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-sdk-php-laravel).
[Fusio](https://github.com/apioo/fusio) is an open source API management system which can be used to build and manage
APIs. In this sample app we show how you can integrate Fusio into a Laravel app.

This means we automatically create a user at Fusio in case a user registers at our Laravel
app. If a user is authenticated it is possible to create apps to access the API build with Fusio.
